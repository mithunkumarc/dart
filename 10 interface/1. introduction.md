#### class considers all its properties are coming from implicitly(by default) implemented interface

            class Game{

              //game_name coming from implicitly implemented interface  
              var game_name;

              //play_game coming from implicitly implemented interface
              void play_game(){
                print("playing game...");
              }

              //constructor is part of Game class
              Game(this.game_name);

            }
            main(List<String> args) {
              Game game =Game("prince of persia");
              print(game.game_name);
              game.play_game();
            }
            // output : 
            // prince of persia
            // playing game...
            

#### Class implementing another class as interface : 

            class MusicPlayer{
              void play(){
                print("music player playing music...");
              }
            }
            class SonyMusicPlayer implements MusicPlayer{
              @override
              void play() {
                print("sony music player playing music..");
              }
            }

            playButton(MusicPlayer player) => player.play();

            main(List<String> args) {
              MusicPlayer musicPlayer =MusicPlayer();
              SonyMusicPlayer sonyMusicPlayer =SonyMusicPlayer();
              playButton(musicPlayer);
              playButton(sonyMusicPlayer);
            }

            output : 
            music player playing music...
            sony music player playing music..
