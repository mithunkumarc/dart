#### set and get for instance varible

            class Person{
              var _name;            //private to current file/library
              set name(var value) => _name = value;
              get name => _name;   
            }
            
            main(List<String> args) {
              var person =Person();
              person.name = "rajat";
              print(person.name);
            }

            output : rajat


#### set and get method can be used to create new properties using existing properties

#### set : value of new prop cant be chaged/set directly

            new property cannot be set directly as it is derived from other properies , 
            so in setter method, change value of those prop which changes new property
            

#### set : write only, get : read only


            class Rectangle{
              num left,top,width,height;

              //right property created from left and width
              num get right => left + width;

              //becuase right property created from left and width
              //value of right must affect left and width in some way
              //when you print right, you will get right value with respect to new value of left and width
              set right(num value)  {
                print(right);//left + width : 8
                left = width;//new left and width both are 6
                print(right);//6 + 6 = 12
              } 

              Rectangle(this.left,this.top,this.width,this.height);
            }


            main(List<String> args) {
              var rectangle =Rectangle(2,4,6,8);
              rectangle.right = 25;

            }


#### example 2

          class Bowler{
            num runs;
            num overs;

            //whenever we try to get economy value , it depends on runs value divided by overs value
            get economy => runs/overs;
            
            //as economy is new property derived from runs and overs,so
            //change runs and overs in a way which changes economy back
            set economy(num value_eco)  {
                runs = value_eco * overs;
            }

            Bowler(this.runs,this.overs);
          }
          main(List<String> args) {
            var bowler =Bowler(50,10);
            bowler.economy  = 6;
            print(bowler.runs);//runs changed from 50 to 60
            print(bowler.overs);//overs remains same : 10
            print(bowler.economy);//economy also setteles to same value becuase of runs/overs : 6

          }
          
          output : 
          60
          10
          6.0
